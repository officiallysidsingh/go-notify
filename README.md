# **GoNotify â€“ Event-Driven Notification System**

ðŸš€ **GoNotify** is a lightweight, event-driven notification system built with **Golang** and **RabbitMQ**, designed to seamlessly integrate with any backend server. It enables reliable, asynchronous notification delivery across multiple channels, ensuring scalability and high performance.

## **Key Features**

âœ… **Seamless Integration** â€“ Works with any backend (REST, GraphQL, gRPC).\
âœ… **Event-Driven Architecture** â€“ Decoupled and scalable notification handling.\
âœ… **RabbitMQ-Based Queuing** â€“ Ensures reliable and asynchronous processing.\
âœ… **Multi-Channel Support** â€“ Easily extendable to Email, SMS, WebSockets, Push.\
âœ… **Observability** â€“ Built-in logging, metrics, and monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.\
âœ… **High Performance & Scalability** â€“ Optimized for real-time event handling.

## **Tech Stack**

ðŸ”¹ **Golang** â€“ High-performance backend development\
ðŸ”¹ **RabbitMQ** â€“ Message broker for async event processing\
ðŸ”¹ **Prometheus & Grafana** â€“ Monitoring, logging, and observability\
ðŸ”¹ **PostgreSQL** â€“ Notification status storage\
ðŸ”¹ **Redis** â€“ Rate limiting notifications

## **Use Case**

Ideal for **e-commerce, SaaS, fintech, and microservices**, GoNotify enables real-time notifications for order updates, system alerts, and user engagement, ensuring a responsive and scalable event-driven architecture.

## **Design Decisions for GoNotify**

### Event-Driven Architecture

- **RabbitMQ** is chosen over **Kafka** for the following reasons:
  - **Message Acknowledgment & Delivery Guarantees**: RabbitMQâ€™s robust message acknowledgment mechanism ensures reliable message delivery.
  - **Routing & Fan-out Patterns**: RabbitMQ supports Direct Exchange, useful for routing notifications (email, SMS, push).
  - **Lower Throughput Requirement**: RabbitMQ is ideal for scenarios where the focus is on reliability over massive throughput.

### Tech Stack Decisions

#### gRPC vs REST

- **gRPC**: Chosen for internal communication between microservices, offering better performance and bi-directional streaming.
- **REST**: Used for communication with third-party services like **Twilio** and **SendGrid** for external notifications.
- **Decision**: Hybrid Approach â€” **gRPC** for internal calls, **REST** for external third-party integrations.

#### Message Broker: RabbitMQ

- **Queues**: Separate queues per notification type (email, SMS, push).
- **Exchanges**: Direct, Topic, and Fan-out exchanges are configured for routing notifications to appropriate channels.
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Implemented for retrying failed notifications.

#### Database: PostgreSQL + Redis

- **PostgreSQL**: Used for storing **notification logs**, offering ACID properties and relational capabilities.
- **Redis**: Utilized for **rate limiting**, ensuring notifications are not sent too frequently.

### Observability

- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used for **metrics and monitoring**, providing insights into system performance.
- **Loki** is used for **logging**, enabling efficient storage and querying of logs.

### Deployment

- **Docker** containers for consistent environments across development and production.

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## **Installation**

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-notify.git
   cd go-notify
   ```

2. **Configure the environment:**
   Update the configuration in config/config.yaml as needed.
   You can also refer to config/config.example.yaml for environment variable settings.

3. **Run the services using Docker Compose:**
